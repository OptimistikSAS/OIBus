# OIBus GitHub Repository Security Policy

## 1. Purpose

Welcome to the OIBus GitHub Repository! Our security policy is designed to ensure the safety and integrity of our
codebase and sensitive information. By following these guidelines, we aim to protect the repository and maintain its
availability for all users.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to everyone who interacts with the OIBus GitHub repository, including contributors, maintainers, and
users. It covers all aspects of repository management, such as code contributions, access control, and incident
response.

## 3. Responsibilities

### For Repository Owners and Maintainers

- **Access Control**: Ensure that only authorized individuals have access to the repository. Regularly review and update
  access permissions to maintain security.
- **Code Review**: Implement a mandatory code review process for all pull requests to identify and address security
  vulnerabilities early.
- **Dependency Management**: Regularly review and update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities and keep the
  repository secure.
- **Incident Response**: Establish and maintain an incident response plan to address security incidents promptly and
  effectively.

### For Contributors

- **Secure Coding Practices**: Follow secure coding practices to minimize the introduction of vulnerabilities in your
  contributions.
- **Reporting Vulnerabilities**: If you identify any security vulnerabilities or concerns, report them to the repository
  maintainers immediately at oibus@optimistik.com. Your vigilance helps keep our repository secure.

## 4. Access Control

- **Least Privilege Principle**: We grant the minimum level of access necessary for contributors to perform their tasks.
  This helps limit potential damage if an account is compromised.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: We enforce the use of multi-factor authentication for all users with write
  access to the repository, adding an extra layer of security to your account.
- **Regular Access Reviews**: We conduct regular reviews of access permissions to ensure that access is still necessary
  and appropriate.

## 5. Code Management

- **Branch Protection Rules**: We implement branch protection rules to prevent unauthorized changes to critical branches
  like `main` and `stable`.
- **Dependency Scanning**: We use dependency scanning tools to identify and address vulnerabilities in project
  dependencies, ensuring a secure codebase.

## 6. Incident Response

- **Incident Reporting**: Report security incidents and vulnerabilities to oibus@optimistik.com. Avoid sharing them
  publicly, as this could facilitate potential exploits. When reporting, provide as many details as possible to help
  maintainers reproduce and fix the issue quickly.

Following the incident reporting:

- **Incident Investigation**: We conduct thorough investigations of security incidents to understand their root cause and
  impact.
- **Remediation**: We implement measures to remediate security incidents and prevent their recurrence.

## 7. Compliance

- **Policy Review**: We review and update this security policy regularly to ensure its effectiveness and relevance.
- **Compliance Monitoring**: We monitor compliance with this policy and take appropriate action in response to
  violations.

## 8. Contact Information

For any security-related questions or concerns, please contact the OIBus repository maintainers at oibus@optimistik.com.
