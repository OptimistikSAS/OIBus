# Common South settings
## Add a connector
To add a South connector, click on the Engine menu, and select _Add South_. Select one of the available South 
connector types, name the connector and validate by clicking on _Add_.

## Main settings
The window may change depending on the type of connector selected. However, some concepts are the same. The 
navigation submenu (the gray bar at the page top) allows to change the connector name (top left) or to access the 
status of the connector (top right).

The status window displays several metrics, depending on the connector.

The connector can be enabled or disabled from the toggle action at the top of the **General Settings** section.
