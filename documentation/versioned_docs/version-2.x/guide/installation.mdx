# Installation

Let's install OIBus in less than 2 minutes.

## Requirements
To operate, OIBus must be installed on an environment with the following minimum characteristics:
- **64 bits architecture**. 32bits and ARM architectures are not supported.
- **RAM: 2GB minimum**. OIBus may require more RAM depending on the configuration of South and North connectors.
- **Disk space: 200 MB**. For the application. It is however recommended to have extra space (several GB, depending on
your data stream) to store the collected data in the cache if an upstream network failure occurs.
- **Admin rights** on the environment to install OIBus and register it as a service (for Windows and Linux).
- **Modern web browser** (IE not supported). Used to access the OIBus configuration interface. The browser can be on the
targeted computer or on another, provided you have configured the [necessary access](engine/access.md).

## Access OIBus interface
OIBus configuration interface is available on `http://localhost:2223` (assuming the default port has been kept).

:::caution Default access
By default, the user is **admin** and the password is **pass**.

We strongly advise to change the password in the Engines settings.

:::

When installing OIBus, remember to choose an appropriate name. The _Engine name_ is important mainly if you use several
OIBus and send the logs to a remote [loki instance](./engine/logging-parameters.md#loki).
