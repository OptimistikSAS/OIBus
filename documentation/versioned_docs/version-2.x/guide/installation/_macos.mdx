:::caution

Apple chip Mac (M1) are not supported yet with binaries. However, it is possible to start OIBus from the
[source code](https://github.com/OptimistikSAS/OIBus)!

:::

MacOS OIBus binary can be run through its executable. Once unzipped, start a Terminal and enter the following command:

<CodeBlock>
    {`./oibus --config ./oibus.json`}
</CodeBlock>

The `./oibus.json` file path must be adapted according to the place where the OIBus cache and config will be stored.

For example, if the binary is stored in `/bin/` and the cache and configuration files are stored in
`~/test/oibus-data`, the command will be:

<CodeBlock>
    {`/bin/oibus --config ~/test/oibus-data/oibus.json`}
</CodeBlock>

:::caution

Be sure to have admin permissions to run the binary
