   registrations page.
4. Click on the **Add** button of your OIBus.
5. In the new modal, input the registration code displayed on OIBus and select access rights with API permissions.
6. Upon verification of the registration code's correctness, OIBus will finalize the registration process.

## OIAnalytics logs

If configured within the logging parameters section of
the [OIBus Engine settings](./engine-settings.md#日誌參數), logs have the capability to be transmitted via
HTTPS to OIAnalytics, allowing access to them on the OIAnalytics OIBus log page.

## Commands

OIBus periodically checks for commands on OIAnalytics. Upon execution, OIBus promptly sends acknowledgments back to
OIAnalytics.

### Upgrade command

An OIAnalytics user has the ability to initiate an upgrade command by selecting the desired version for upgrading OIBus
to a newer release.

Initially, OIBus retrieves the upgrade command and then requests OIAnalytics to download the corresponding binary from
GitHub. Upon download completion, the zip file is unpacked in the designated update folder, inside the installation
directory of OIBus. Subsequently, the data folder is backed up, and OIBus is exited.

The launcher actively monitors the process exit and checks the update folder for the presence of a new version. If a
new version is found, the launcher proceeds to copy the new binaries into the binary folder and run the OIBus process.

In the event of a failure during the upgrade process, the previous version and its associated data folder are restored
to ensure system stability and continuity.
