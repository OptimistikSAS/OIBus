# OLEDB
Send SQL queries to a remote [OIBus Agent](../oibus-agent/oledb.md) that can manage OLEDB queries on the same machine as the server.

The OIBus agent can be installed separately, as specified in its [documentation](../oibus-agent/installation).

This connector proves valuable when retrieving data from OSIsoft PI OLEDB interfaces or other OLEDB-compatible applications.

## Specific settings
- **Remote agent URL**: Specify the URL of the remote OIBus agent, e.g., http://ip-address-or-host:2224.
- **Connection string**: The OLEDB connection string.
- **Connection timeout**: Timeout setting for establishing the connection.
- **Request timeout**: Determine the timeout duration for each query.
- **Retry interval**: Time to wait before retrying connection.
