# OIAnalytics (Rest API)
Retrieve data from the [Optimistik OIAnalytics](https://optimistik.com/oianalytics/) application.

## Specific settings
Here are the configuration details:

- **URL**: This is the address of the OIAnalytics application.
- **Accept unauthorized certificate**: Decide whether to accept certificates even if they are outdated or self-signed.
- **Access key**: Provide the access key used for authentication.
- **Secret key**: Enter the secret key used for authentication.
- **Use proxy**: Choose whether to route the request through a proxy.

## Item settings
In the South connector, each item can be configured to be queried according to the chosen scan mode. Multiple queries to
the same database can be configured within the same South connector. OIBus will execute the queries one after another,
prepare the output file, and then send it to North connectors.

### Endpoint
The endpoint where to send the HTTP request, for instance `/api/oianalytics/data/values`.

### Query params
The **Query params** field can utilize internal variables. These variables serve two primary purposes:
ensuring data stream resilience in case of connection failures and breaking down large intervals into smaller chunks,
thus reducing the load on both the server and the network (as explained in the [big queries section](#splitting-large-queries)).

#### Query variables
In OIBus, you can utilize the following internal variables that will be interpreted by the system:

- **@StartTime**: Initially, the @StartTime variable is set to the date of the first execution of the query. When results
are retrieved from the application, the @StartTime value is updated to the most recent timestamp among those results in the
field used as a reference (refer to [the datetime fields section](#datetime-fields)).
- **@EndTime**: The @EndTime variable is set to either the current time (_now()_) or the end of the sub-interval if a
query is split.
