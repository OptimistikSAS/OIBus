### CSV Serialization
OIBus offers the option to serialize retrieved data into CSV files, and you can customize the serialization process with
the following settings:
- **Filename**: The name of the file where the result will be stored. You can use several internal variables like
**@ConnectorName** (the name of the connector) and **@CurrentDate** (the current date in `yyyy_MM_dd_HH_mm_ss_SSS` format).
- **Delimiter**: The delimiter to use in the CSV.
- **Compression**: Choose whether to compress the file with gzip or not.
- **Output datetime format**: Specify the format of the datetime in the CSV. OIBus will only convert the
[datetime fields](#datetime-fields) specified.
- **Output timezone**: The timezone to use for storing the datetime.

## Splitting large queries
In situations where a query may impose a significant load on the server, especially when a large time interval is requested
and the @StartTime and @EndTime [query variables](#query-variables) are utilized, you can split the query into several
sub-queries with smaller intervals. This can be achieved by configuring the **Max read interval** field in the
[history settings](./common-settings.md#history-settings).
