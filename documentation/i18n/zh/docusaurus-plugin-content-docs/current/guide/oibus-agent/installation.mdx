# Concept and installation
OIBus Agent is a tool used to embed through HTTP some protocol specific queries. For now, [ODBC](./odbc) and
[OPCHDA](./opchda) are supported.

OIBus can request the agent through its South connectors [ODBC](../south-connectors/odbc) and [OPCHDA](../south-connectors/opc-hda).
