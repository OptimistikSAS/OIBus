# OIAnalytics
The OIAnalytics SaaS application is equipped to handle both JSON and file payloads. JSON payloads consist of formatted 
data points obtained from various South point protocols such as OPCUA and MQTT.

Files, on the other hand, are transmitted exactly as they are received by the North connector, whether compressed or not. 
OIAnalytics has the capability to manage various file formats, including CSV, TXT, and XLSX. OIAnalytics offers the advantage 
of its built-in file parsers, alleviating the necessity for any pre-processing of data. The parsing process seamlessly 
unfolds within the SaaS application, courtesy of its easily configurable settings.

## Specific settings
Here are the important parameters for configuring connectivity with the OIAnalytics SaaS application:

- **Host**: The hostname of the SaaS application (e.g., `https://optimistik.oianalytics.com`).
- **Accept unauthorized certificate**: This option is useful when HTTP queries traverse a firewall that strips the 
certificate.
- **Access key**: The access key generated by OIAnalytics.
- **Secret key**: The secret key corresponding to the generated access key.
- **Timeout**: The duration before a connection failure is reported in HTTP requests.
- **Use proxy**: An option to utilize a proxy for sending HTTP requests.
- **Proxy URL**: The URL of the proxy server to pass through.
- **Proxy username**: The username associated with the proxy.
- **Proxy password**: The password linked to the proxy.


## OIAnalytics access
Data sent to OIAnalytics is transmitted through the OIAnalytics public API. API access in OIAnalytics is linked to a user 
account. Instead of conventional login credentials, an API key must be established within OIAnalytics using the following 
steps:
1. Navigate to Configuration -> Users.
2. Locate the user for whom you intend to generate an API key, and click on the key icon.
3. Create an API key to generate a new API key. Be sure to copy and securely store both the key and its associated password.
4. In OIBus, fill the API key and the associated secret key.

:::danger Password retrieval
It's crucial to emphasize that the API key generation is the only opportunity to access and copy the password associated 
with it. If you happen to lose this password, you will need to generate a new API key in order to obtain it.

:::tip API user
We recommend creating a dedicated API user in OIAnalytics with exclusive API access. It's advisable to assign a unique 
API key to each OIBus instance. This approach offers the advantage of easier key management, allowing you to revoke a 
specific API key if necessary without affecting other instances.
