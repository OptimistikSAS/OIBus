# Installation Requirements
Let's get OIBus up and running in under 2 minutes.

## System Requirements
In order to successfully install OIBus, your environment should meet the following minimum specifications:
- **RAM: 2GB**. A minimum of 2GB is required, although the actual RAM needed may vary depending on your specific configuration.
- **Disk Space: 200 MB**. You'll need at least 200 MB of disk space for the application. However, it's advisable to have
additional space (several GB, depending on your data stream) to store collected data in case of an upstream network failure.
- **Administrative Privileges**: You must have administrative rights on your environment to install OIBus and register
it as a service. This applies to both Windows and Linux platforms.
- **Modern Web Browser**: You'll need a modern web browser to access the OIBus configuration interface. The browser can
reside on the same computer as OIBus or on a different one, as long as you configure the
[necessary access settings](../engine/ip-filters.md). Note: Internet Explorer is not supported.
