# GitHub Release

OIBus uses [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) and GitHub Action to automate release on push on the `stable`
branch. It will release patch, minor or major version following the
[conventional commit standard](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). Simply merge the release branch to create a release.
