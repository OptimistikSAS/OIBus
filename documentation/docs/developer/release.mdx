# GitHub Release
OIBus uses [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) and GitHub Action to automate release on push 
on the `stable` branch. It will release patch, minor or major version following the [conventional commit standard](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). 
Simply merge the release branch to create a release.
