# GitHub Release Process

OIBus uses [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) with GitHub Actions to automate the release process. The version bump (patch, minor, or major) follows the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) standard.

:::info GitHub Actions Requirement
For this to work on your fork:

1. Enable GitHub Actions in your fork's settings
2. Ensure you have write permissions to the repository

## 📦 Automated Release Process

### How It Works

1. **Trigger**: When commits are added to the `stable` branch
2. **Release PR**: release-please automatically creates a release Pull Request with:

- Version bump based on commit types
- Generated changelog
- Updated package versions

3. **Version Determination**: Based on commit messages since last release:

- `fix:` → Patch version (0.0.x)
- `feat:` → Minor version (0.x.0)
- `feat!:`, `BREAKING CHANGE:` → Major version (x.0.0)

4. **Release Creation**: When the release PR is merged to `stable`:

- GitHub release is automatically created
- Release branch is created/updated (e.g., `release-v1.2.3`)
- Changelog is published

### Release Types

| Commit Type                  | Version Bump  | Example                  |
| ---------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------ |
| `fix:`                       | Patch (0.0.x) | `fix: correct minor bug` |
| `feat:`                      | Minor (0.x.0) | `feat: add new feature`  |
| `feat!:`, `BREAKING CHANGE:` | Major (x.0.0) | `feat!: change API`      |

## 🆕 Creating a Pre-Release

For testing purposes before merging to `stable`, you can manually create pre-releases:

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Navigate to Releases**:

- Go to your fork's GitHub repository
- Click on "Releases" in the right sidebar
- Click "Draft a new release"

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
  <div>![Draft a GitHub release](../../static/img/developer/draft-release.png)</div>
</div>

2. **Configure the Release**:

- **Tag version**: Use semantic versioning (e.g., `v1.2.3-alpha.1`)
- **Target**: Select your working branch (usually `main` or feature branch)
- **Release title**: Follow pattern "v1.2.3 (Pre-release)"
- **Description**: Add:
  - Key changes since last release
  - Known issues
  - Testing instructions
- **Pre-release**: ✅ Check this box
- **Set as latest release**: ❌ **Do NOT check** this box

3. **Pre-release Best Practices**:

- Use suffixes: `-alpha.x`, `-beta.x`, `-rc.x`
- Example: `v2.1.0-beta.1`
- Include "[Pre-release]" in the title
- Clearly mark experimental features

4. **Publish**: Click "Publish release"
