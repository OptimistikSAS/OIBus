# Advanced use case
## Beforehand
This use case shows an advanced setup of a heterogeneous network:
- Operational Technology (OT) in the industrial network with PLCs
- Information Technology (IT) in the enterprise network

## Several OIBus
In this configuration, two OIBus are set up: **OIBus OT** and **OIBus IT**. This way, only one connection between the OT and
IT networks needs to be allowed through the internal firewall.
**OIBus OT** sends data to OIAnalytics through the proxy server of **OIBus IT**.

In such a scenario, it is better to first set up the **OIBus IT** with its proxy server and the proper network firewall rules.

## OIBus IT
### South Connectors
#### MSSQL
The connection to the MSSQL database is straightforward and can be simply set up from [this use case](./use-case-mssql)
and the [connector documentation](../guide/south-connectors/mssql).

#### MQTT
This connector can be used to subscribe to MQTT topic, as specified in [this page](../guide/south-connectors/mqtt).

#### Folder Scanner
In this example, a script generates data files (like CSV files) in a folder which OIBus can scan to retrieve the files according
to a regex, as specified in [this page](../guide/south-connectors/folder-scanner).

This scenario is useful when OIBus does not have a direct access to the database.

#### ODBC (with Remote OIBus Agent)
In the network example, the [ODBC South connector](../guide/south-connectors/odbc) uses an [OIBus Agent](../guide/oibus-agent/installation) that must be installed on the
IP21 machine. It is possible to refer to the [IP21 use case](./use-case-ip21) for a proper setup.

#### OSIsoft PI (with Remote OIBus Agent)
In the network example, the [OSIsoft PI South connector](../guide/south-connectors/osisoft-pi) uses an [OIBus Agent](../guide/oibus-agent/installation) that must be installed on the
IP21 machine. It is possible to refer to the [OSIsoft PI use case](./use-case-ip21) for a proper setup.

### North Connectors
#### OIAnalytics
It is strongly suggested to first [register OIBus into OIAnalytics](../guide/engine/oianalytics-module) and to use the
registration inside the [North OIAnalytics connector](../guide/north-connectors/oianalytics).

### Proxy server
Enable the [proxy server](../guide/engine/engine-settings#proxy-server) and be sure the selected port is not used and is allowed on the firewall for inbound connections.

## OIBus OT
This OIBus can be used to access PLCs located in the industrial network.

### South Connectors
#### TwinCAT ADS
Refer to the [TwinCAT ADS use case](./use-case-ads) to properly set up the connector. Here, the ADS server is remote.

#### OPCUA
Refer to the [OPCUA use case](./use-case-opcua) to properly set up the connector.

#### Modbus
Refer to the [Modbus use case](./use-case-modbus) to properly set up the connector.

### North Connectors
#### OIAnalytics
It is strongly suggested to first [register OIBus into OIAnalytics](../guide/engine/oianalytics-module) with the help of
a proxy and to use the registration inside the [North OIAnalytics connector](../guide/north-connectors/oianalytics).

The proxy to use is the one set up on the **OIBus IT**. Be sure that a connection is possible through the firewall.
