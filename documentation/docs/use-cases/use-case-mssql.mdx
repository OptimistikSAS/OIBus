# Microsoft SQL Server™ → Azure Blob Storage™

## Beforehand

This use case shows how to set up an SQL connector (here with MSSQL), particularly working on SQL queries with some tuning and how to send
the resulting CSV files into Azure Blob.

Details regarding the configurations can be located on the [North Azure Blob Storage](../guide/north-connectors/azure-blob.md) and
[South Microsoft SQL Server™](../guide/south-connectors/mssql.mdx) connectors pages.

This specific scenario is constructed around the depicted fictional network.

## South MSSQL

Make sure you have the URL or IP address of the MSSQL server, along with its associated port, and a read-only user.

:::caution Read only user
While a read-only user is not mandatory, it is strongly recommended to prevent the insertion or update of data
through a SQL query. South connectors are designed for accessing data, not for creating new entries.
:::

With the proposed schema, the following settings can be set:

- Host: `10.0.0.1`
- Port: `1433`
- Database: `oibus-test`

### SQL Queries

OIBus provides query variables such as `@StartTime` and `@EndTime`. However, their usage is not mandatory.

#### Without variable

In this example, a moving window interval can regularly retrieve the data without the need for such variables, between now and yesterday:

```SQL
SELECT timestamp, message, level FROM table
WHERE timestamp > DATEADD(DAY,-1,GETDATE()) AND timestamp <= GETDATE()
```

:::caution DateTime type
Ensure that you compare the date with a field of the same date type, such as a DateTime type. Use a
[cast or convert function](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/functions/cast-and-convert-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver16) to
appropriately handle the field or your comparison date.
:::

In this scenario, the datetime fields section can still be employed to parse dates and output them in the appropriate format. Only the
`timestamp` is a date time field, and we do not use it as a reference because it is not utilized with `@StartTime` or `@EndTime`.

    ![MSSQL item without variable](../../static/img/use-cases/mssql-item-1.png)

  </div>
</div>

#### With variables

The `@StartTime` variable captures the last maximum instant retrieved from a previous query. By default, for the initial query, it takes the
current time minus one hour. The `@EndTime` variable is replaced by the current time.

To prevent overloading the server with a large query, you can divide the \[`@StartTime`, `@EndTime`\] interval into smaller chunks. This can
be configured in the **History settings** section, from the connector settings:

- Max read interval (in seconds): If set to 60 seconds, and the interval is 1 hour, 60 sub-interval queries will be generated.
- Read delay (in milliseconds) between each sub-interval query.
- Overlap (in milliseconds) deduced a number of milliseconds from the `@StartTime` of the interval that will be chunked, expanding the query
  interval while still allowing the retrieval of data before the last maximum instant retrieved.

  </div>
</div>

:::caution When to use overlap?
Overlap proves beneficial when certain retrieved data exhibit latency and are stored after the query has
been executed. In such cases, it allows for a slight extension of the requested interval.

Exercise caution if your query involves aggregation, as it might alter your data by shifting the time origin of the first interval.
:::

```SQL
SELECT timestamp, message, level FROM logs
WHERE timestamp > @StartTime AND timestamp <= @EndTime
```

##### Date time fields

One date time field can be added:

- Field name: timestamp
- Reference field: true
- Type: ISO 8601

The `timestamp` field contains a date-time in ISO-8601 format. It serves as a reference, implying that it will be stored in the maximum
instant of the South cache.

##### Serialization

- Type: `csv`
- Filename: `sqlite-@CurrentDate.csv`
- Output date time format: `yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSS'Z'`
- Output timezone: `Europe/Paris`
- Delimiter: `Comma ,`

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
  <div>

    ![MSSQL item with variable](../../static/img/use-cases/mssql-item-2.png)

  </div>
</div>

##### Result

Note that the filename with `@CurrentDate` will always be formatted `yyyy_MM_dd_HH_mm_ss_SSS`.

## North Azure Blob

Be sure to have the user credentials with access to an Azure Blob container with write access.

Create the Azure Blob North connector and populate the relevant fields:

- Account: `oibus`
- Container: `test-oibus`
- Path: `north-local-oib`

If **Path** is kept empty, the files will be stored at the root container.
