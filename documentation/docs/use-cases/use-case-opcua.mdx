# OPC UA™ → OIAnalytics®

## Beforehand

Details regarding the configurations can be located on the [North OIAnalytics®](../guide/north-connectors/oianalytics.md) and
[South OPC UA™](../guide/south-connectors/opcua.mdx) connectors pages.

Additionally, ensure that the selected protocol for connection is OPC UA, distinguishing it from
[OPC Classic™](../guide/south-connectors/opc.mdx), which represent entirely distinct technologies.

This specific scenario is constructed around the depicted fictional network.

## South OPC UA

The complete URL format for the OPC UA server should adhere to the following structure:

```
opc.tcp://<host>:<port>/<name>
```

Here's a breakdown:

- `host` represents either the host name or IP address of the server (e.g., `10.0.0.1`).
- `port` specifies the port through which the server accepts connections (e.g., `53530`).
- `name` indicates the name assigned to the OPC UA server (e.g., `OPCUA/SimulationServer`). For instance, in this example, the OPC UA server
  URL is `opc.tcp://10.0.0.1:53530/OPCUA/SimulationServer`.

Specify the security mode supported by your server. If it differs from None, provide details about the security policy as well. Using `None`
for authentication with OIBus is discouraged, except for testing purposes.

Ensure you have the necessary credentials or certificates for authentication, which can be obtained from your IT team or the individual
overseeing the OPC UA server.

You can verify the connection by testing the settings using the `Test settings` button.

### Items

Add the node ID you wish to read. Consult the person in charge of the OPC UA server to determine the available data points.

You have the option to choose the access `mode` (DA or HA). In HA mode, you can aggregate and resample the data. Ensure that the server
supports the selected aggregate and resampling options. If in doubt, stick with the `Raw` aggregate.

Opt for a [scan mode](../guide/engine/scan-modes.md) to fetch the data. In HA mode, a list of values is retrieved for an item since the last
value was obtained, while in DA mode, only one value is retrieved at the requested time for one item.

For bulk item import, start by clicking the `Export` button to obtain a CSV file with the correct columns. Each line
in the file will correspond to a new item. Ensure that the names are unique.
