# IP Filters

By default, OIBus only allows local access. If you need to access OIBus from a remote workstation, you must add the remote IP address.

OIBus supports both **IPv4** and **IPv6** formats. Ensure the IP address is correctly specified.

## Allow Remote Access

To allow access from a remote IP address, you can use the following `curl` command with the default credentials:

```bash title="Allow all IP addresses"
curl --location 'http://localhost:2223//api/ip-filters' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--data '{
  "address": "*",
  "description": "Allow all traffic"
}'
```

:::info
For a complete list of available endpoints, visit the [API documentation page](../../api/index.mdx).
:::

:::danger
Allowing all IP addresses (`"address": "*"`) can be risky, especially when using the [proxy server](./engine-settings.mdx#proxy-server). The proxy forwards requests without authentication, so it is safer to restrict access to trusted IP addresses.
:::

:::tip Best Practices

- Restrict access to trusted IP addresses.
- Avoid using "\*" in production environments.
