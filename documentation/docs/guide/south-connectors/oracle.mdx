# Oracle Database™
Query data from an Oracle Database™.

## Specific Settings

To configure the SQL connector for querying an Oracle Server, provide the following details:

- **Thick mode**: When enabled, uses the Oracle Client Library to access the database. More details [here](https://node-oracledb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/introduction.html#node-oracledb-thick-mode-architecture).
  - **Oracle Client Library**: Path to the installed Oracle Client Library on the host machine.
- **Host**: Address of the Oracle server.
- **Port**: Server port (default is `1521`).
- **Connection timeout**: Maximum time allowed to establish the connection.
- **Database**: Name of the target database.
- **Username**: Username for authentication.
- **Password**: Corresponding password.

:::tip Thin vs. Thick Mode
OIBus supports both *thin* and *thick* modes via the `oracledb` driver. Thin mode does **not** require the Oracle Instant
Client, making it easier to set up (no native binaries, no `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` — just pure JavaScript).
Refer to the compatibility matrix below to determine which mode is appropriate for your Oracle version.

### Oracle Database Version Compatibility with OIBus

| Oracle DB Version | Thin Mode Support           | Thick Mode Support (with Instant Client) | Notes                                       |
|-------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **19c or newer**  | ✅ Supported                | ✅ Supported                             | Recommended version                         |
| **12.2** (12c R2) | ✅ Supported                | ✅ Supported                             | Minimum version for thin mode               |
| **12.1** (12c R1) | ⚠️ Not officially supported | ✅ Supported                             | Thin mode may work but is not guaranteed    |
| **11.2** (11g R2) | ❌ Not supported            | ✅ Supported (with Instant Client 11.2+) | Minimum version for thick mode              |
| **10g or older**  | ❌ Not supported            | ❌ Not supported                         | Not compatible with OIBus                   |

## Oracle Instant Client

Oracle Instant Client is **only required for thick mode**.

In thick mode, OIBus’s compatibility with Oracle Database versions depends on the version of the Oracle Instant Client in use.

According to Oracle’s client-server interoperability policy, Oracle Instant Client 18.x can connect to Oracle Database **11.2 and newer**.

:::caution Minimum Oracle Instant Client Version
The minimum supported version for Oracle Instant Client (Basic or Basic Light) is **18.5.0.0.0**.
:::

You can download the Oracle Instant Client [here](https://www.oracle.com/fr/database/technologies/instant-client/winx64-64-downloads.html).

Thus, when using Oracle Instant Client 18.5.0.0.0 with OIBus, compatibility is ensured for Oracle Database **11.2 and above**.

:::tip Best Practice for Database Access
For security and data integrity, it is strongly recommended to use a **read-only** user when connecting to the database.
