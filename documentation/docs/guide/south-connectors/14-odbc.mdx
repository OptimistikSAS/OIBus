# ODBC
Send SQL queries to a local ODBC driver or to a remote OIBus Agent that can manage ODBC queries on the same machine as
the server.

The OIBus agent can be installed separately, as specified in its [documentation](../oibus-agent/installation).

## Specific settings
- **Use remote agent**: If no, be sure to have an ODBC [driver installed](#driver-installation) on the machine where
OIBus is installed. Otherwise, you can [install an OIBus agent](../oibus-agent/installation) on a remote machine
with the appropriate drivers.
- **Remote agent URL**: The URL of the remote OIBus agent (for example `http://ip-adress-or-host:2224`)
- **Connection string**: The ODBC connection string
- **Password**: The password used for authentication. It is stored securely in OIBus configuration. If put directly in the
connection string, the password will be stored in plaintext. When a password is used, OIBus add `PWD=<password>` at the
end of the connection string.
- **Connection timeout**: Timeout on connection
- **Request timeout**: Timeout for each query

The ODBC connection string must respect the driver format. Be sure to have installed the driver specified in the
connection string.

:::tip ODBC connection string example
`Driver={driver};SERVER=localhost,10014;TrustServerCertificate=yes;Database=test;UID=oibus;PWD=<secret>`

The driver is either the name of the driver (Windows) or the path of the driver file (unix like systems).
The port is optional, and can be replaced by `PORT=10014` (be sure to replace the comma `,` by a semicolon `;`).
:::

### Driver Installation
On Windows, you can directly access the ODBC driver management tool. You can then specify the name of the driver in the
connection string (for example `MySQL ODBC 3.51 driver` or `SQL Server`...).

On UNIX like systems, install it on your machine and specify the path of the driver in the connection string (for example:
`/opt/lib/libmsodbcsql.18.dylib`)


### Using OIBus with IP21
ODBC connections are often laggy. With large historian queries, specially with IP21, it can overload both the network
and the server.

We suggest to install the OIBus Agent as a service on the same machine as IP21. OIBus send the query to its agent with
the HTTP protocol, and the agent communicate directly to IP21 with ODBC, without any network latency.

Of course, the appropriate ODBC driver must be installed on the agent machine, and this driver must be specified in
the connection string.

:::tip IP21 ODBC driver
You can connect to IP21 through ODBC with the driver `AspenTech SQLplus`. Be sure it is installed on your machine
:::


:::caution ODBC Access
The authentication can be pass through the connection string, but it can also be done locally, as with IP21. If so, be sure
the OIBus agent run with the correct permission. Maybe run the service as another user, from the service management windows.
:::

The following connection string works with a basic IP21 installation: `Driver={AspenTech SQLplus};HOST=<host>;PORT=10014"`
