# ODBC
Send SQL queries to a local ODBC driver or to a remote [OIBus Agent](../oibus-agent/odbc.md) that can manage ODBC
queries on the same machine as the server.

The OIBus agent can be installed separately, as specified in its [documentation](../oibus-agent/installation).

This connector proves valuable when retrieving data from IP21 ODBC interfaces or other ODBC-compatible applications.

## Specific settings
- **Use remote agent**: If set to `No`, ensure that an ODBC [driver is installed](#driver-installation) on the machine
where OIBus is deployed. Alternatively, you can opt to [install an OIBus agent](../oibus-agent/installation) on a remote
machine equipped with the necessary drivers.
- **Remote agent URL**: Specify the URL of the remote OIBus agent, e.g., http://ip-address-or-host:2224.
- **Connection timeout**: Set the timeout for establishing a connection.
- **Request timeout**: Determine the timeout duration for each query.
- **Connection string**: The ODBC connection string.
- **Password**: The authentication password, securely stored within OIBus configuration. If directly included in the
connection string, the password will be stored in plain text. When a password is used, OIBus appends `PWD=<password>` to
the end of the connection string.

Please ensure that the ODBC connection string adheres to the specified driver format, and it is imperative to have the
driver specified in the connection string correctly installed.

:::tip ODBC connection string example
`Driver={driver name};SERVER=localhost,10014;TrustServerCertificate=yes;Database=test;UID=oibus;PWD=<secret>`

The driver is either the name of the driver (Windows) or the path of the driver file (unix like systems).
The port is optional, and can be replaced by `PORT=10014` (be sure to replace the comma `,` by a semicolon `;`).

### Driver Installation
On Windows, you can conveniently access the ODBC driver management tool, where you can specify the driver's name in the
connection string, such as `MySQL ODBC 3.51 driver` or `SQL Server`.

On UNIX-like systems, you should first install the driver on your machine and then specify the driver's path in the
connection string, like `/opt/lib/libmsodbcsql.18.dylib`, for example.

### Using OIBus with IP21
ODBC connections often suffer from latency issues, particularly during large historian queries, such as those involving
IP21. This can place a heavy load on both the network and the server.

To mitigate these challenges, we recommend installing the OIBus Agent as a service on the same machine as IP21. OIBus
can then transmit queries to its agent using the HTTP protocol, and the agent can communicate directly with IP21 using
ODBC, eliminating network latency.

Of course, it's essential to ensure that the appropriate ODBC driver is installed **on the agent machine** and specified
correctly in the connection string.

:::tip IP21 ODBC driver
To establish a connection to IP21 via ODBC, you will need the `AspenTech SQLplus` driver installed on your machine.
Please ensure that this driver is correctly installed.
:::

:::caution ODBC Access
Authentication can be handled either through the connection string or locally. When choosing local authentication, it's
important to ensure that the OIBus agent runs with the appropriate permissions. You may need to run the service as a
different user, which can be configured through the service management window.

The following connection string works with a basic IP21 installation: `Driver={AspenTech SQLplus};HOST=<host>;PORT=10014"`
