# Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL)
Send SQL queries to Microsoft SQL Server.

## Specific settings
When configuring the SQL connector to send SQL queries to a Microsoft SQL Server, you will need to provide the following
details:
- **Host**: The address of the Microsoft SQL server.
- **Port**: The MSSQL server port (default is 1433).
- **Database**: The name of the database to connect to.
- **Username**: The username used for authentication.
- **Password**: The password used for authentication.
- **Domain** (optional): This field is useful when connecting to an Active Directory domain.
- **Use encryption**: Option to encrypt the data between the database and OIBus (note that encryption can potentially
overload the server).
- **Trust server certificate**: Option to accept server certificates even if they are outdated or self-signed.
- **Connection timeout**: Timeout setting for establishing the connection.
- **Request timeout**: Timeout for each SQL query.

:::tip Database access
It is strongly advised to use a read-only user when connecting to the database for security and data integrity purposes.
