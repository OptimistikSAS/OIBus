# OPC Classic™

OPC Classic™ (HDA/DA) is a communication protocol used in the industrial world and developed by the
[OPC Foundation](https://opcfoundation.org/). This technology has been replaced by OPCUA but is still widely used in
the industry. To use OPC UA™ in OIBus, see the [OPC UA connector documentation](./opcua.mdx).

An HDA server allows to retrieve the history of data over a more or less long period, while a DA server allows to
retrieve only the most recent value of a tag.

Only OPC in HDA mode is supported by OIBus. This connector uses the [OIBus Agent](../oibus-agent/installation.mdx).

:::caution
The OIBus Agent must be installed on a Windows machine.

## Specific settings

OIBus exchanges commands and data with the HDA agent through a TCP server/client communication. Therefore, several
fields must be filled to make OIBus communicate with the OIBus Agent:

- **Remote agent URL**: Specify the URL of the remote OIBus agent, e.g., `http://ip-address-or-host:2224`.
- **Connection timeout**: Set the timeout for establishing a connection.
- **Retry interval**: Time to wait before retrying connection.
- **Server host**: Address of the OPC server (from the remote OIBus agent machine).
- **Server name**: Name of the OPC server (e.g. Matrikon.OPC.Simulation).

## Item settings

When configuring each item to retrieve data in JSON payload, you'll need to specify the following specific settings:

- **Node ID**: The Node ID corresponds to the path of the data within the appropriate namespace on the OPC server.
- **Aggregate**: Aggregate the retrieved values over the requested interval (be sure that the server supports the
  aggregate).
- **Resampling**: When aggregate is different from `Raw`, it is possible to resample the retrieved values at the
  requested
  interval.

:::caution Compatibility with the OPC server
It's important to note that not all aggregation and resampling options are supported by OPC servers. To avoid
compatibility issues, it's recommended to use `Raw` aggregation and `None` resampling whenever possible.

The name of the item will serve as a reference in JSON payloads, specifically in the `pointID` field for the North
application.
