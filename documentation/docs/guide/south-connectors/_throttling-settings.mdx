### Throttling Settings

You can optimize data requests using throttling configurations. These settings help manage large data intervals and network conditions effectively.

#### Key Throttling Parameters

| Setting           | Description                                                                                                                                             | Data Type    | Example Value |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| Max read interval | Maximum duration (in seconds) for each data request interval. Larger intervals are automatically divided into smaller chunks not exceeding this value.  | Seconds      | 3600          |
| Read delay        | Delay (in milliseconds) between consecutive data requests. Helps prevent server overload.                                                               | Milliseconds | 1000          |
| Overlap           | Time overlap (in milliseconds) between consecutive queries to ensure data continuity. This value is subtracted from the `@StartTime` of the next query. | Milliseconds | 60000         |

#### How Throttling Works

1. **Interval Division**:

- Large time ranges are automatically split into smaller intervals
- Each sub-interval does not exceed the `Max read interval` duration
- Example: A 24-hour request with `Max read interval = 3600` (1 hour) will be split into 24 separate 1-hour requests

2. **Request Timing**:

- The `Read delay` introduces a pause between consecutive requests
- Helps manage server load and prevents rate limiting
- Particularly useful during network instability or when querying large datasets

3. **Data Continuity**:

- The `Overlap` setting ensures no gaps in your data
- Creates a time buffer between consecutive queries
- Example: With `Overlap = 60000` (1 minute), each query will include 1 minute of overlapping data with the previous query

:::info Overlap Functionality
The overlap setting modifies the `@StartTime` of each query by subtracting the overlap value from the calculated start time. This adjustment applies to the entire query range, not to individual sub-intervals when large requests are split into smaller chunks.

This functionality is particularly useful when:

- New data is ingested after previous queries have executed
- You need to account for potential ingestion delays in the source system

**Example**:
With `overlap=60000` (1 minute), a query for the interval `[10:00-11:00]` will actually request `[9:59-11:00]`, ensuring capture of any late-arriving data from the previous time period.

### Recommended Configurations

| Scenario                       | Max read interval | Read delay | Overlap        |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------- | ---------- | -------------- |
| Stable network, small datasets | 3600 (1 hour)     | 500        | 0 (no overlap) |
| Unstable network               | 1800 (30 min)     | 2000       | 0 (no overlap) |
| Large historical retrievals    | 7200 (2 hours)    | 1000       | 0 (no overlap) |
| Real-time with occasional gaps | 900 (15 min)      | 200        | 15000 (15 sec) |
