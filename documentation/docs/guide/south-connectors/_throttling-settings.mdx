### Throttling settings
For South connectors capable of historical data retrieval, you have the flexibility to request data
in intervals. These intervals can vary in size, depending on factors such as the chosen scan mode or the presence of
prolonged network failures.

To handle such scenarios, the throttling settings enable you to divide large intervals into smaller sub-intervals, each
no longer than the specified **Max read interval** (in seconds). These sub-intervals are requested with a delay defined
by the **Read delay** setting (in milliseconds).

In certain situations, adding an overlap to the query can be beneficial. You can achieve this by configuring
the **overlap** field (in milliseconds): it will subtract this specified number of milliseconds from the `@StartTime`
variable of the subsequent query.
