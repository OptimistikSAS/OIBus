# SLIM (Rest API)
Retrieve data from the [Agilent SLIMS](https://www.agilent.com/en/product/software-informatics/lab-workflow-management-software/slims)
application, which serves as a comprehensive laboratory management solution.

## Specific settings
Here are the details for configuring your connection:
- **URL**: This is the address of the SLIMS application.
- **Port**: Specify the port that the application is listening on.
- **Username**: Provide the username used for authentication.
- **Password**: Enter the password used for authentication.
- **Use proxy**: Choose whether to route the request through a proxy.
- **Accept unauthorized certificate**: Decide whether to accept certificates even if they are outdated or self-signed.

## Item settings
In the South connector, each item can be configured to be queried according to the chosen scan mode. Multiple queries to
the same database can be configured within the same South connector. OIBus will execute the queries one after another,
prepare the output file, and then send it to North connectors.

### Endpoint
The endpoint where to send the HTTP request, for instance `/slimsrest/rest/Result/advanced`.

### Body and query params
The **Body** field supports JSON syntax and can utilize internal variables. These variables serve two primary purposes:
ensuring data stream resilience in case of connection failures and breaking down large intervals into smaller chunks,
thus reducing the load on both the server and the network (as explained in the [big queries section](#splitting-large-queries)).

The **Query params** field is structured as a key/value array and can also make use of the same interval variables.

#### Query variables
In OIBus, you can utilize the following internal variables that will be interpreted by the system:

- **@StartTime**: Initially, the @StartTime variable is set to the date of the first execution of the query. When results
are retrieved from the application, the @StartTime value is updated to the most recent timestamp among those results in the
field used as a reference (refer to [the datetime fields section](#datetime-fields)).
- **@EndTime**: The @EndTime variable is set to either the current time (_now()_) or the end of the sub-interval if a
query is split.

```json title="Body example with variables"
{
    "criteria": {
        "operator": "and",
        "criteria": [
            {
                "fieldName": "rslt_fk_status",
                "operator": "equals",
                "value": 14
            },
            {
                "fieldName": "rslt_cf_pid",
                "operator": "notNull"
            },
            {
                "fieldName": "rslt_cf_samplingDateAndTime",
                "operator": "notNull"
            },
            {
                "fieldName": "rslt_modifiedOn",
                "operator": "between",
                "start": @StartTime,
                "end": @EndTime
            }
        ]
    },
    "sortBy": [
        "rslt_modifiedOn"
    ]
}
```

### Datetime fields
You can specify in this array which fields are a datetime type, and which format to use.
- **Field name**: The field name in the HTTP payload result.
- **Reference field**: Use this field as reference for the next @StartTime value (see [query variables](#query-variables)).
- **Type**: The type of the data in the result.
- **Timezone** (for string only): The timezone of the datetime stored in the
database.
- **Format** (for string only): The string format of the datetime retrieved.
- **Locale** (for string only): The locale to use when the format contains locale specific string (such as MMM format for
months).

For SLIMS, two datetime fields must be specified:
- **rslt_modifiedOn** (used as reference): this field will be stored in the internal variable @StartTime for the next HTTP request
- **rslt_cf_samplingDateAndTime**: this field is not used as reference but must be specified to be correctly parsed. It will be used
as the timestamp of the value retrieved.

OIBus will internally use these dates in ISO UTC format. The output datetime format can be set in the
[serialization section](#csv-serialization).
