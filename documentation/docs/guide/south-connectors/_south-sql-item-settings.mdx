## Item settings
In the South connector, each item can be configured to be queried according to the chosen scan mode. Multiple queries to
the same database can be configured within the same South connector. OIBus will execute the queries one after another,
prepare the output file, and then send it to North connectors.

### Query
The query field in the South connector accepts SQL syntax and can utilize several internal variables. These variables
serve various purposes, including enhancing data stream resilience in the event of a connection failure and breaking
down large intervals into smaller chunks, which helps reduce the load on the server and network. For more information,
refer to the [big queries](#splitting-large-queries) section.

#### Query variables
In OIBus, you can utilize the following internal variables that will be interpreted by the system:

- **@StartTime**: Initially, the @StartTime variable is set to the date of the first execution of the query. When results
are retrieved from the database, the @StartTime value is updated to the most recent timestamp among those results in the
field used as a reference (refer to [the datetime fields section](#datetime-fields)).
- **@EndTime**: The @EndTime variable is set to either the current time (_now()_) or the end of the sub-interval if a
query is split.

```sql title="SQL query with @StartTime and @EndTime"
SELECT reference, value, timestamp FROM table WHERE timestamp > @StartTime AND timestamp < @EndTime
```

### Datetime fields
In the South connector, you can specify an array of fields that are of datetime type and indicate the format to use for
each field. Here are the details for configuring datetime fields:
- **Field name**: The field name in the SELECT section of the query.
- **Reference field**: Use this field as a reference for the next @StartTime value (refer to [query variables](#query-variables)).
- **Type**: The type of data in the result.
- **Timezone** (for string, Date, DateTime, DateTime2, SmallDateTime types): The timezone of the datetime stored in the
database.
- **Format** (for string only): The string format of the datetime stored in the database.
- **Locale** (for string only): The locale to use when the format contains locale-specific strings (such as MMM format
for months).

OIBus internally uses these dates in ISO UTC format, and the output datetime format can be set in the
[serialization section](#serialization).
