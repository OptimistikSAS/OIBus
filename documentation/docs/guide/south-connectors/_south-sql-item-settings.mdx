## Item settings
### Query
The query fields accept SQL syntax and can use several internal variables. These variables are useful for data stream
resilience on connection failure, and to cut big intervals into smaller chunks, reducing the load on the serve and network
(see [the big queries section](#splitting-large-queries).

#### Query variables
Several OIBus variables can be used and will be interpreted by OIBus.
- **@StartTime**: The @StartTime variable initially takes the date of the first execution of the query. When results are
retrieved from the database, @StartTime value is set to the most recent timestamp among those results in the field used
as reference (see [the datetime fields section](#datetime-fields)).
- **@EndTime**: The @EndTime variable is set to the current time (_now()_) or to the end of the sub-interval if a query is split.

#### Example
```sql
SELECT reference, value, timestamp FROM table WHERE timestamp > @StartTime AND timestamp < @EndTime
```
### Datetime fields
You can specify in this array which fields are a datetime type, and which format to use.
- **Field name**: The field name in the SELECT section of the query.
- **Reference field**: Use this field as reference for the next @StartTime value (see [query variables](#query-variables)).
- **Type**: The type of the data in the result.
- **Timezone** (for string, Date, DateTime, DateTime2, SmallDateTime types): The timezone of the datetime stored in the
database.
- **Format** (for string only): The string format of the datetime stored in the database.
- **Locale** (for string only): The locale to use when the format contains locale specific string (such as MMM format for
months).

OIBus will internally use these dates in ISO UTC format. The output datetime format can be set in the
[serialization section](#serialization).

### CSV Serialization
- Filename: The name of the file where the result will be stored. Several internal variable can be used:
- @ConnectorName: The name of the connector.
- @CurrentDate: The current date in yyyy_MM_dd_HH_mm_ss_SSS format.
- Delimiter: The delimiter to use in the CSV.
- Compression: Compress the file with gunzip or not.
- Output datetime format: The format of the datetime in the CSV. OIBus will only convert the
[datetime fields](#datetime-fields) specified.
- Output timezone: The timezone to use to store the datetime.

## Splitting large queries
In some cases, a query can be quite heavy for the server, especially if a large time interval is requested. If
@StartTime and @EndTime [query variables](#query-variables) are used, the query can be split in several sub-queries
with smaller intervals using the **Max read interval** field of [history settings](./common-settings.md#history-settings).
