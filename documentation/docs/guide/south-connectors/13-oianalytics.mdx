# OIAnalytics (Rest API)
Send HTTP queries to an OIAnalytics application.

## Specific settings
- **URL**: the address of the OIAnalytics application
- **Access key**: the access key used for authentication
- **Secret key**: the secret key used for authentication
- **Use proxy**: Pass the request through a proxy
- **Accept unauthorized certificate**: Accept certificates even if outdated or selfsigned

## Item settings
## Item settings
- **Endpoint**: The endpoint where to send the HTTP request.
- **Request timeout**: Time to wait before the HTTP request fails.

### Body and query params
The query params field is a key / value array and can use interval variables. These variables are useful for data stream
resilience on connection failure, and to cut big intervals into smaller chunks, reducing the load on the serve and network
(see [the big queries section](#splitting-large-queries)).

#### Query variables
Several OIBus variables can be used and will be interpreted by OIBus.
- **@StartTime**: The @StartTime variable initially takes the date of the first execution of the query. When results are
retrieved from the database, @StartTime value is set to the most recent timestamp among those results in the field used
as reference (see [the datetime fields section](#datetime-fields)).
- **@EndTime**: The @EndTime variable is set to the current time (_now()_) or to the end of the sub-interval if a query is split.
