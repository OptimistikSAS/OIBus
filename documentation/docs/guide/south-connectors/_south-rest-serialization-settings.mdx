### CSV Serialization
- Filename: The name of the file where the result will be stored. Several internal variable can be used:
  - @ConnectorName: The name of the connector.
  - @CurrentDate: The current date in yyyy_MM_dd_HH_mm_ss_SSS format.
- Delimiter: The delimiter to use in the CSV.
- Compression: Compress the file with gunzip or not.
- Output datetime format: The format of the datetime in the CSV. OIBus will only convert the
[datetime fields](#datetime-fields) specified.
- Output timezone: The timezone to use to store the datetime.

## Splitting large queries
In some cases, a query can be quite heavy for the server, especially if a large time interval is requested. If
@StartTime and @EndTime [query variables](#query-variables) are used, the query can be split in several sub-queries
with smaller intervals using the **Max read interval** field of [history settings](./common-settings.md#history-settings).
