  Download OIBus for Linux (x64)
</DownloadButton>

To install or update OIBus, you should run the installation script. To do that, you may either download from the above
button and unzip the downloaded file, or use the following cURL or Wget command:

```
curl -o- -L https://github.com/OptimistikSAS/OIBus/releases/download/v2.3.3-setup-fix.4/oibus-linux.tar.gz | tar -xzv
```


```
wget -c https://github.com/OptimistikSAS/OIBus/releases/download/v2.3.3-setup-fix.5/oibus-linux.tar.gz -O - | tar -xzv
```

The following files have been extracted:
```
default-config.json     // default configuration that will be updated during the installation process
oibus                   // OIBus binary
oibus-setup.sh          // installation script
oibus-uninstall.sh      // uninstallation script that will be updated during the installation process
```

Bash scripts have been tested on Ubuntu. They interact with the user to fill the first OIBus configuration, and set OIBus
as a service. Alternatively, it is possible to [run OIBus binary only](#run-oibus-in-standalone).

## Installation of OIBus as a Linux service
The installation script can be run with the following command. The admin rights will que required during the script execution.
```
./oibus-setup.sh
```

The following questions will be asked during the installation (default answers have been kept in this example):
```
Administrative permissions are required to proceed. Do you wish to continue? (Y/n)
Administrative permissions granted.
Enter the directory in which you want to install the OIBus binary (default: ./OIBus/):
Enter the directory in which you want to save all your OIBus related data, caches, and logs (default: ./OIBusData/):
Enter a username for your session. It will be used every time you log into OIBus (default: admin):
Enter a name for your OIBus. It will help to identify your OIBus, and assist in potential troubleshooting (default: OIBus):
Enter the port on which you want OIBus to run (default 2223):
Installing oibus service...
Service file successfully created. Enabling oibus service startup on system boot...
Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/default.target.wants/oibus.service → /etc/systemd/system/oibus.service.
Starting OIBus service...
Setting oibus-uninstall.sh...
Installation procedure completed !

Useful commands:
        Check service status:   sudo systemctl status oibus
        Check service-logs:     sudo journalctl -u oibus -f

Access OIBus: http://localhost:2223/
```

## Update
To update OIBus, download the latest version, unzip the archive and run the setup install:
```
./oibus-setup.sh
```

During the installation process, fill the OIBus directory and OIBus data directory with the already existing directories.
At start, OIBus will automatically update the configuration file (oibus.json) and the cache structure if needed. Here is
an output example, the default values:

```
Administrative permissions are required to proceed. Do you wish to continue? (Y/n)
Administrative permissions granted.
Enter the directory in which you want to install the OIBus binary (default: ./OIBus/):
Enter the directory in which you want to save all your OIBus related data, caches, and logs (default: ./OIBusData/):
An oibus.json file was found. Do you want to use it for this OIBus? (Y/n)
Stopping oibus service...
Removed /etc/systemd/system/default.target.wants/oibus.service.
The oibus service has been stopped and disabled!
Installing oibus service...
Service file successfully created. Enabling oibus service startup on system boot...
Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/default.target.wants/oibus.service → /etc/systemd/system/oibus.service.
Starting OIBus service...
Setting oibus-uninstall.sh...
Installation procedure completed !

Useful commands:
        Check service status:   sudo systemctl status oibus
        Check service-logs:     sudo journalctl -u oibus -f
```

## Uninstall OIBus
An uninstallation script has been created in the OIBus binary folder. Once in this folder, enter the following command:
```
oibus-uninstall.sh
```

Here is an output example:

```
Administrative permissions are required to proceed with uninstall. Do you wish to continue ? (Y/n)
Administrative permissions granted.
Do you wish to remove all OIBus data (cache, logs...)? All data, credentials and logs about your current OIBus will be permanently erased. (y/N) y
Removed /etc/systemd/system/default.target.wants/oibus.service.
OIBus service was successfully removed.
```

By default, the data are kept if you want to reinstall OIBus later. You can remove them, but you will lose all credentials
and the whole OIBus configuration.

## Run OIBus in standalone
If you want to run OIBus without installing it as a service, once the archive downloaded and unzipped, you can run
the following command:

```
./oibus --config ./OIBusData/oibus.json
```

Make sure the OIBusData folder already exists. The cache, logs and configuration files are stored in this folder (in the
example `OIBusData`).
