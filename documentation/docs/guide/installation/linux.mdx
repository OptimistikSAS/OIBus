You also have the option to obtain the files using this command:
<CodeBlock>
{ `curl -LO https://github.com/OptimistikSAS/OIBus/releases/download/v${packageInfo.version}/oibus-linux_arm64-v${packageInfo.version}.zip` }
{ `\r\nunzip -a oibus-linux_arm64-v${packageInfo.version}.zip -d OIBus/`}
</CodeBlock>

The following files have been extracted:
```
oibus-launcher          // OIBus launcher to run the binary
binaries/oibus          // OIBus binary
oibus-setup.sh          // installation script
oibus-uninstall.sh      // uninstallation script that will be updated during the installation process
```

Bash scripts have been tested on Ubuntu. They are used to set OIBus as a service. Alternatively, it is possible
to [run OIBus binary only](#run-oibus-in-standalone).

## Installation of OIBus as a Linux service
You can execute the installation script using the following command, and administrative privileges will be necessary
during the script's execution.

```
sudo ./oibus-setup.sh
```

During the installation process, the following questions will be presented (default answers are provided in this example):
```
Administrative permissions are required to proceed. Do you wish to continue? (Y/n)
Administrative permissions granted.
Enter the directory in which you want to install the OIBus binary (default: ./OIBus/):
Enter the directory in which you want to save all your OIBus related data, caches, and logs (default: ./OIBusData/):
Enter a username for your session. It will be used every time you log into OIBus (default: admin):
Enter a name for your OIBus. It will help to identify your OIBus, and assist in potential troubleshooting (default: OIBus):
Enter the port on which you want OIBus to run (default 2223):
Installing oibus service...
Service file successfully created. Enabling oibus service startup on system boot...
Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/default.target.wants/oibus.service → /etc/systemd/system/oibus.service.
Starting OIBus service...
Setting oibus-uninstall.sh...
Installation procedure completed !

Useful commands:
        Check service status:   sudo systemctl status oibus
        Check service-logs:     sudo journalctl -u oibus -f

Access OIBus: http://localhost:2223/
```

Get familiar with the OIBus interface on the [first access page](./first-access.mdx).

## Update
To perform an OIBus update, download the most recent version, extract the compressed archive, and initiate the setup
installation.
```
sudo ./oibus-setup.sh
```

At start, OIBus will automatically update the configuration `oibus.db` and the cache structure if needed. Here is
an output example:
```
Administrative permissions are required to proceed. Do you wish to continue? (Y/n)
Administrative permissions granted.
Enter the directory in which you want to install the OIBus binary (default: ./OIBus/):
Enter the directory in which you want to save all your OIBus related data, caches, and logs (default: ./OIBusData/):
An oibus.json file was found. Do you want to use it for this OIBus? (Y/n)
Stopping oibus service...
Removed /etc/systemd/system/default.target.wants/oibus.service.
The oibus service has been stopped and disabled!
Installing oibus service...
Service file successfully created. Enabling oibus service startup on system boot...
Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/default.target.wants/oibus.service → /etc/systemd/system/oibus.service.
Starting OIBus service...
Setting oibus-uninstall.sh...
Installation procedure completed !

Useful commands:
        Check service status:   sudo systemctl status oibus
        Check service-logs:     sudo journalctl -u oibus -f
```

## Uninstall OIBus
An uninstallation script has been provided within the OIBus binary directory. When inside this folder, input the following
command:
```
sudo ./oibus-uninstall.sh
```

Here is an output example:
```
Administrative permissions are required to proceed with uninstall. Do you wish to continue ? (Y/n)
Administrative permissions granted.
Do you wish to remove all OIBus data (cache, logs...)? All data, credentials and logs about your current OIBus will be permanently erased. (y/N) y
Removed /etc/systemd/system/default.target.wants/oibus.service.
OIBus service was successfully removed.
```

As a default setting, the configuration is retained if you intend to reinstall OIBus at a later time. However, it is
possible to remove it, but doing so will result in the loss of all credentials and the entire OIBus configuration.

## Run OIBus in standalone
If you prefer to run OIBus without installing it as a service, after downloading and unzipping the archive, you can
execute the following command:

```
./oibus-launcher --config ./OIBusData
```

Ensure that the OIBusData directory is already in place, as it serves as the storage location for cache, logs, and
the configuration database (`OIBusData` in the example).
