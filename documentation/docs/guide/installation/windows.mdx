During the update, OIBus service will be stopped briefly.

The configuration database `oibus.db` will be updated to its latest version during the first startup.

### With binaries (from zip file)
Once you unzip the files from the zip file:

1. Go to the Windows service manager.
2. Stop the OIBus service.
3. Copy and paste the content of the zip file into the OIBus executable folder. Overwrite all existing files.
4. Start the OIBus service.

The configuration database `oibus.db` will be updated to its latest version during the first startup.
