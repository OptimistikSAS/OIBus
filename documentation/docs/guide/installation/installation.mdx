# Installation

Let's get OIBus up and running in under 2 minutes.

## System Requirements

In order to successfully install OIBus, your environment should meet the following minimum specifications:

- **RAM: 2GB**. A minimum of 2GB is required, although the actual RAM needed may vary depending on your specific configuration.
- **Disk Space: 200 MB**. You'll need at least 200 MB of disk space for the application. However, it's advisable to have additional space
  (several GB, depending on your data stream) to store collected data in case of an upstream network failure.
- **Administrative Privileges**: You must have administrative rights on your environment to install OIBus and register it as a service. This
  applies to both Windows and Linux platforms.

:::caution
You'll need a modern web browser to access the OIBus configuration interface. The browser can reside on the same computer as
OIBus or on a different one, as long as you configure the [necessary access settings](../engine/ip-filters.md).

Internet Explorer is not supported.
