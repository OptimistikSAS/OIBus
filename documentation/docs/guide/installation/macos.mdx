macOS OIBus binary can be run through its executable. Once unzipped, start a Terminal and enter the following command:

<CodeBlock>
  {`./oibus-launcher --config ./data-folder`}
</CodeBlock>

The `./data-folder` path must be adapted according to the place where the OIBus cache and config will be stored.

For example, if the binary is stored in `/bin/` and the cache and configuration files are stored in
`~/test/oibus-data`, the command will be:

<CodeBlock>
  {`/bin/oibus-launcher --config ~/test/oibus-data`}
</CodeBlock>

:::caution
Be sure to have admin permissions to run the binary
:::

:::caution Allow the app to be executed
On macOS, you may need to allow the execution of the binary. When first run, go to the System Settings, on the Privacy &
Security menu, and allow the oibus-launcher in the Security section.

Get familiar with the OIBus interface on the [first access page](./first-access.mdx).
