# First access
OIBus configuration interface is available on `http://localhost:2223`.

:::caution Default access
By default, the user is **admin** and the password is **pass**.

We strongly advise to change the password in the [user settings](#user-settings).

## OIBus pages
### Home page
The OIBus home page show enabled connectors and the engine with their associated metrics.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

  ![Home page](../../../static/img/guide/installation/first_access/home-page.png)

</div>

The magnifying glass icon redirect you to the display page of the connector or of the engine.

### Engine
The engine page allows you to set logger, [Scan Modes](../engine/scan-modes.md), [IP Filters](../engine/ip-filters.md)
and [External Sources](../engine/external-sources.md).

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

  ![Engine](../../../static/img/guide/installation/first_access/engine.png)

</div>

The restart button and the shutdown button has an effect on the engine only, not on the service. It means it will shut down
the connectors, but not the web service, which allows you to still access the OIBus interface.

When installing OIBus, remember to choose an appropriate name. The _Engine name_ is important mainly if you use several
OIBus and send the logs to a remote [loki instance](../engine/engine-settings.md#loki) or when you register OIBus into OIAnalytics.

[Registering OIBus into OIAnalytics](../engine/oianalytics-module) is useful when sending data to a [North OIAnalytics](../north-connectors/oianalytics)
connector and when sending logs to OIAnalytics. From OIAnalytics, once registered, you can update OIBus remotely or parse the logs.

:::tip Allow remote access by adding an IP filter with curl
If you want to automatize the setup of OIBus, and access it remotely, you can send a curl command to accept connection
from various IP addresses. Here is an example that accepts all IP addresses.

```curl title="curl command"
curl --location --request POST "http://localhost:2223/api/ip-filters" --header "Content-Type: application/json" --data-raw "{\"address\": \"*\", \"description\": \"All\" }" -u "admin:pass"
```

The log page automatically refreshes every 10 seconds. You have the ability to filter the logs based on dates, log level,
