# First access
OIBus configuration interface is available on `http://localhost:2223`.

:::caution Default access
By default, the user is **admin** and the password is **pass**.

We strongly advise to change the password in the user settings.
:::

When installing OIBus, remember to choose an appropriate name. The _Engine name_ is important mainly if you use several
OIBus and send the logs to a remote [loki instance](../engine/engine-settings.md#loki).
