# First Access

OIBus configuration interface is available on http://localhost:2223.

:::caution Default access
By default, the user is **admin** and the password is **pass**.

We strongly advise to change the password in the [user settings](#user-settings).
:::

## Home Page

The OIBus home page shows enabled connectors and the engine with their associated metrics.

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>![Home page](../../../static/img/guide/installation/first_access/home-page.png)</div>

The magnifying glass icon redirects you to the display page of the connector or of the engine.

## Engine

The engine page allows you to set [logging parameters](../engine/engine-settings.mdx#logging-parameters), [Scan Modes](../engine/scan-modes.md) and [IP Filters](../engine/ip-filters.md).

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>![Engine](../../../static/img/guide/installation/first_access/engine.png)</div>

:::note
The restart button and the shutdown button affect the engine only, not the service. It means it will shut down the connectors, but not the web service, which allows you to still access the OIBus interface.
:::

:::tip Allow remote access by adding an IP filter with curl
If you want to automatize the setup of OIBus, and access it remotely, you can send a curl command to accept connection from various IP addresses. Here is an example that accepts all IP addresses.

```bash
curl --location --request POST "http://localhost:2223/api/ip-filters" \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data-raw '{"address": "*", "description": "All"}' \
-u "admin\:pass"
```
