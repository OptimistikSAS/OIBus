# Concept and installation
OIBus Agent is a tool used to embed through HTTP some protocol specific queries. For now, [ODBC](./odbc) and OPCHDA
are supported.

OIBus can request the agent through its South connectors [ODBC](../south-connectors/odbc).

## Installation
Unzip the archive, from which you will get three files:
- OIBusWindowsAgent.exe: binary used to run the agent
- install-agent.bat: script used to install the agent as a Windows service (port 2224)
- uninstall-agent.bat: script used to uninstall the service

## Running the agent
If you just want to run the agent without using the service manager, simply run the following command in a terminal:

`OIBusWindowsAgent.exe`

That will run the OIBus agent on its default HTTP port 2224. You can specify another port with:

`OIBusWindowsAgent.exe -p 2225`
