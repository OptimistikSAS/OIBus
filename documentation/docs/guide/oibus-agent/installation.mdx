# Concept and installation
OIBus Agent is a tool used to embed through HTTP some protocol specific queries. For now, [ODBC](./odbc) and
[OPCHDA](./opchda) are supported.

OIBus can request the agent through its South connectors [ODBC](../south-connectors/odbc) and [OPCHDA](../south-connectors/opc-hda).

## Setup
Unzip the archive, from which you will get three files:
- OIBusAgent.exe: binary used to run the agent
- install-agent.bat: script used to install the agent as a Windows service
- uninstall-agent.bat: script used to uninstall the service

### Installation
By default, running `install-agent.bat` install the agent as a service with the name `OIBusAgent` and will listen to port `2224`:
```
install-agent.bat
```

But it is also possible to specify a name and a port through the command line:
```
install-agent.bat -n="My OIBus Agent" -p=2225
```

### Uninstalling
If the agent has been set up with default values, running the uninstallation script is enough:
```
uninstall-agent.bat
```

If the agent has been installed with a specific name, you must specify its name:
```
uninstall-agent.bat -n="My OIBus Agent"
```

## Running the agent
If you just want to run the agent without using the service manager, simply run the following command in a terminal:
```
OIBusAgent.exe
```

That will run the OIBus agent on its default HTTP port 2224. You can specify another port with:
```
OIBusAgent.exe -p 2225
```
